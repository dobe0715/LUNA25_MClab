## Dataset Configuration


### Preprocessing
For six datasets that don't match with mask_dataset, we exclude them.

***

* `valid_1-1.csv`
    * All malignant datasets are included valid_1-1.csv. And some benign datasets are also included to that file.

* `train_other.csv`
    * The others(all benign) are all included to train_other.csv.
